Description:

This sample shows a very basic game written on top of the new Silverlight/XNA application model.

Sample Overview

One of the new features available to developers targeting Windows Phone OS 7.1 is the ability to mix Silverlight UI and XNA Framework rendering in the same application. This sample contains a very basic game written using the Silverlight application model, with XNA Framework rendering the main portion of the game and using Silverlight UI to render the scores at the top of the screen.

Note the gameplay of this sample is in landscape mode, so when using the emulator be sure to use the controls in the upper right to rotate the emulator into landscape mode.
