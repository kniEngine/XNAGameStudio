Sample Overview

This sample shows how animations can be baked into a rigid or skinned model using a 3D content creation tool that would typically require game logic, by simply loading and playing the animation. The two examples presented in this sample are a rigid cube that falls apart as it hits the ground and a skinned "Dude" model that can walk through a scene without having to be moved by using code.
 
These examples are useful for different reasons. When using a rigid model, for instance, an artist can create a complex explosion effect like the one pictured, without having to incorporate any complex physics capabilities into the game code. For a skinned model, a good place to use this technique might be inside a cutscene, where the artist can develop the entire scene independent of code.
