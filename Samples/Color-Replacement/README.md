Description:

This sample demonstrates how to render parts of an object with a user-defined color.

Sample Overview

When it's the Red Team versus the Blue Team, or when you want to drive a car painted with your favorite color, you either need to create a texture for each color or perform color replacement programmatically. This sample implements color replacement by using an artist-defined alpha map that acts like a spray paint stencil. The stencil enables you to have soldiers with any color armor you choose, without tinting their faces the same color.
