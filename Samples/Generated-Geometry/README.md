Code Sample

---

Description:

This sample shows how 3D models can be generated by code during the XNA Content Pipeline build process.


Sample Overview

The sample renders a simple terrain with a sky behind it. The input data consists entirely of textures: a height-field bitmap describing the terrain, and a sky bitmap. Custom content pipeline processors convert the height-field bitmap into geometry, and generate a skydome mesh for rendering the sky texture.
