The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern is a great way to separate the data from the user interface in your application. This sample demonstrates a simple MVVM application that uses XAML binding to connect the Views to the Model. The application in this sample is a “game tracker” in which the user can keep track of their achievements in a video game. This sample also uses a custom data converter, maintains page state when navigating to and from the application, and saves application data to isolated storage.
