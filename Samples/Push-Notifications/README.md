Description:

This sample shows how to use push notifications within an XNA Framework application on Windows Phone 7. Includes a tool to send test messages.

Sample Overview

Push Notifications for Windows Phone 7 consist of two projects: a Windows Phone 7 client application and a Winforms sender application. When the client application is run, either in the emulator or on a device, it obtains and displays the unique URI for the application's notification channel. Copying this URI to the sender application allows test messages to be sent to the phone.
