Description:

This tutorial explains how to perform per-pixel collision detection in two dimensions on sprites that use linear transformations such as rotation or scale.

This tutorial builds on the previous tutorial in this series, [Collision Series 2: 2D Per-Pixel Collision](https://github.com/kniEngine/XNAGameStudio/tree/main/Samples/Collision-Series-2-2D-Per-Pixel-Collision/). Follow the steps in the previous tutorials before starting this one.

Tutorial Overview

In the previous tutorial, you enhanced your simple obstacle avoidance game by adding per-pixel collisions, which are more accurate than the previously existing bounding rectangle test. The per-pixel technique presented in tutorial 2 accommodates only positioned sprites, without any other transformations. For many games, this is completely sufficient. However, if your game requires objects that are rotated, scaled, or otherwise linearly transformed, you are going to need a more sophisticated per-pixel collision test.
