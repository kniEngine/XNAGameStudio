Description:

This sample shows how to process and render a skinned character model by using the XNA Framework Content Pipeline.
 

Sample Overview

Out of the box, the XNA Framework provides only partial support for animation. It defines an intermediate object model for storing animation data inside the Content Pipeline, and can import data into this object model from FBX and X formats. The built-in ModelProcessor also converts vertex channels of BoneWeightCollection data into pairs of channels with VertexElementUsage BlendIndices and BlendWeight, suitable for skinned rendering on the GPU. However, the framework doesn't include any runtime animation classes. That functionality is implemented by this sample.
