Description:

This sample shows you how to implement basic shadow mapping from a directional light where the view and projection of the shadow map adapt to the viewing frustum of the viewer's camera. You can use the sample to shadow a large scene with multiple dynamic objects that cast dynamic shadows

Sample Overview

Shadow mapping refers to a shadowing technique where you can use a texture to store an object's distance from a light. When you render the scene, you can then use the distance from the light to determine whether the pixel being rendered is behind the value stored in the shadow map.
