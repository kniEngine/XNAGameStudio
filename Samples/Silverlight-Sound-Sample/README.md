Download the Silverlight Sound Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use the XNA Framework's SoundEffect and SoundEffectInstance classes to play multiple sounds simultaneously in a Silverlight application for Windows Phone. It also shows a simple way to set up a DispatchTimer to call FrameworkDispatcher.Update in order to simulate the Game loop for the XNA Framework's internals. Finally, it shows how to load a wave audio file into a Stream that can be played by the SoundEffect classes.
