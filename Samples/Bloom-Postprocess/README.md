Description: 

This sample shows how to use bloom post-processing filters to add a glow effect over the top of an existing scene.

Sample Overview

Bloom post-processing emulates the visual effect of bright lights and glowing objects. It does this by extracting the brightest parts of an image to a custom render target, blurring these bright areas, and then adding the blurred result back into the original image.

Because bloom is implemented entirely as a post-process, it can easily be used over the top of any other 2D or 3D rendering techniques. In addition to the more extreme glowing effects, when used subtly it provides a useful softening that can make computer graphics look more organic and help to hide artifacts from elsewhere in your rendering. Particle systems, for example, often look better with a subtle bloom applied over the top.
