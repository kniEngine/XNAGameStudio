Code Sample

Description:

The Role-Playing Game sample is a complete game, ready to compile and run. You're free to use its source code as the basis for your own XNA Game Studio game projects, and to share your work with others.

Sample Overview

This sample contains a two-dimensional role-playing game that uses a tile engine. The game comes complete with character classes, multiple party members, items, and quests. It also features a turn-based combat engine with a side-on presentation with animated characters and effects. Additionally, all game data are exposed in XML files, making it easy to write your own quests, create your own towns, or even write your own storyline.

All gameplay content is loaded into the Content Pipeline by using XML, making it easy to add, replace or modify assets you want in your own role-playing game.
