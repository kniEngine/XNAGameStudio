Sample Overview

The sample consists of a 3D scene of a spaceship, rendered by using BasicEffect. The user can alter the way the model is rendered and displayed. Initially, the model is rendered against a clear blue background by using three different light sources. By using various on-screen buttons and touch gestures, the user can alter rendering options.
