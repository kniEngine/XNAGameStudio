Description:

The SpriteBatch shader represents the source code for the drawing functionality of the SpriteBatch object in the XNA Framework. It is provided as HLSL source code in a .fx file, along with an instructional document that describes the workings of the shader and how you can integrate it into your XNA Game Studio project.

Utility Overview

This HLSL code is provided for educational purposes. It may be a useful starting point when you create more advanced shaders of your own. You can achieve many advanced graphical effects by using SpriteBatch alongside a custom pixel shader without needing to change the vertex shader. The vertex shader is heavily optimized for both Windows and Xbox 360 and may be more difficult to extend.
