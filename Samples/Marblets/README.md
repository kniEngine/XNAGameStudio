This sample provides a complete game, including source code and game content such as models, textures, and sounds.

Marblets is a puzzle-style game that challenges you to eliminate groups of same-colored bubbles. The more bubbles you eliminate at one time, the higher your score. This starter kit version offers only a few game modes, providing ample opportunity to add your own unique game types and modes.
